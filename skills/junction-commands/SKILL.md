## Pods (Isolated Worktree Test Instances)

Ephemeral, full-stack Junction gateways — one per feature worktree — that run on
their own port + isolated `JUNCTION_HOME` and never touch the live `:5476`
gateway or shared data. Linux `systemd --user` only. `<wt>` is a worktree name
(resolved by directory basename or `feat/<name>` branch convention).

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `junction pod install` | Lay down the systemd --user template unit (once per machine) |
| `junction pod provision <wt>` | Build the worktree's venv + SPA dist (the on-ramp) |
| `junction pod up <wt>` | Bring up an isolated pod (auto-builds venv; fails if dist missing) |
| `junction pod up <wt> --provision` | Provision (venv + dist build) then bring up |
| `junction pod up <wt> --json` | Bring up and print `{base_url, token, port}` as JSON |
| `junction pod ls` | List running pods |
| `junction pod status <wt>` | Up/down + health for one pod |
| `junction pod token <wt>` | (Re)mint a dashboard token for a running pod |
| `junction pod url <wt>` | Print the pod's base URL |
| `junction pod logs <wt> -n N` | Tail the pod's journal |
| `junction pod down <wt>` | Evict the pod and delete its isolated HOME |
| `junction pod exec <wt> -- <args>` | Run a junction command against a pod, using the pod's own binary and data |

**Platform:** Linux only. On macOS/Windows every systemd-touching verb refuses
with a one-line message pointing at `./dev-backend.sh` — it does not crash, and
`pod install` writes no unit file. `pod url` works anywhere (pure computation).

Port derivation: `base + (cksum(name) % 199) + 1` (base `7810` → `7811..8009`).
Override with `PORT=` in `~/.kiro/crew/pods/<name>.env`.

See `src/junction/pod/README.md` for the full reference.

## Dashboard Access

| `junction logout` | Revoke all active dashboard sessions |
| `junction manifest` | Generate Slack app manifest with your alias |
| `junction manifest --url` | Print one-click Slack app creation URL |

## Chat

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `junction chat` | Interactive chat (REPL mode) |
| `junction chat -m "message"` | Single message (non-interactive) |
| `junction chat --model claude-opus` | Use specific model |

## Browsing (`playwright-cli`)

Browsing is not a `junction` subcommand and not an MCP tool. You drive a browser by
running `playwright-cli` shell commands. It is available when the binary is on
`PATH`. **Settings → Browser** installs it with one click (and holds the optional
attach token); the equivalent by hand is `npm install -g @playwright/cli@latest`
(Node.js 20 or newer).

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `playwright-cli open <url>` | Open a page (prints URL, title, and a snapshot path) |
| `playwright-cli snapshot` | Write the accessibility tree to a YAML file, print its path |
| `playwright-cli click <ref>` / `fill <ref> <text>` | Act on an element from a snapshot |
| `playwright-cli screenshot [ref]` | Write a PNG, print its path. `[ref]` is an ELEMENT, not a path; do not pass `--filename` (it resolves against the CWD and is not auto-approved) |
| `playwright-cli state-save` / `state-load <file>` | Save or restore a logged-in session. Bare `state-save` writes into the service's own directory; both a name and `state-load` prompt for approval, because each names a local path |
| `playwright-cli attach --extension` | Drive the user's own running Chrome, with their logins |
| `playwright-cli show --port <n> --host 127.0.0.1` | Serve the CLI's dashboard for the Browser panel |

**Browsing workflow:** load the `web-browse`, `web-verify`, or `browser-auth`
skill for the shape of the task, then:
1. `command -v playwright-cli`. Absent means browsing is unavailable: read the page
   with `web_fetch` and tell the user the install command.
2. `playwright-cli open <url>`. The printed URL and title usually confirm the page
   without reading anything else.
3. Read the snapshot YAML at the printed path only when you need the tree, for
   example before clicking. Refs like `[ref=e5]` belong to that snapshot, so
   re-snapshot after any page change.
4. On a login redirect, the session is absent or expired: `state-load` a saved
   session, or ask the user to sign in in the Browser panel and `state-save` it.

**No npm access (internal registry, air-gapped host):** detection is **PATH-based**
-- `playwright-cli` on `PATH` is all that matters, so ANY install route works and the
Settings button is a convenience, not the only one. In order of likelihood:

1. Most internal registries proxy npmjs, so the plain install already works.
2. Force the public registry for this one package:
   `npm install -g @playwright/cli --registry=https://registry.npmjs.org`.
3. **An internal registry that requires a login the user does not have** (the
   common Amazon-internal / corporate case). Install into a user-owned prefix
   against the public registry, ignoring the corporate `.npmrc` for this one
   command, then put the binary on `PATH`:

   ```bash
   NPM_CONFIG_USERCONFIG=/dev/null \
     npm install --prefix ~/.local/share/playwright-cli \
     --registry=https://registry.npmjs.org @playwright/cli@0.1.18
   mkdir -p ~/.local/bin
   ln -sf ~/.local/share/playwright-cli/node_modules/.bin/playwright-cli \
     ~/.local/bin/playwright-cli
   ```

   Two caveats worth stating to the user rather than burying: `~/.local/bin` has
   to be **on `PATH`** or Kiro Crew still reports "not installed" (detection is
   `PATH` + the Node bin dirs, nothing else); and `NPM_CONFIG_USERCONFIG=/dev/null`
   deliberately ignores their employer's registry configuration, which is their
   call to make, not ours to assume.
4. Air-gapped: `npm pack @playwright/cli` on a connected machine, copy the
   `.tgz` over, then `npm install -g ./playwright-cli-<version>.tgz`. Note the
   tarball alone is not runnable -- it needs its `playwright` /
   `playwright-core` dependencies resolved too.

What does **not** substitute for it: `pip install playwright` and
`dotnet tool install Microsoft.Playwright.CLI` install a DIFFERENT tool -- the
`playwright` browser-installer/codegen CLI, not `@playwright/cli` (binary
`playwright-cli`, its own 0.x line, which depends on `playwright@1.63.0-alpha`).
Switching to yarn, pnpm or bun hits the same registry, so it only helps when the
`npm` client itself is missing. And there is **no standalone binary**: the
upstream GitHub release carries no build assets and `playwright-cli.js` starts
with `#!/usr/bin/env node`, so Node.js 18+ is required no matter how it is
fetched.

**Approval:** page-scoped verbs run without prompting the user, because installing
the CLI is itself the consent. Verbs that reach the local machine still prompt on
purpose -- `eval`, `run-code`, `upload`, `state-load`, a named `state-save`, and the
installers. Let the user approve those rather than rewriting the command to dodge
the prompt.

The full verb list is in the skill `playwright-cli install --skills agents --global`
writes.

## Agents & Workspaces

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `junction agent list` | List Junction agents |
| `junction agent create --name NAME` | Create a new agent |
| `junction agent create --name NAME --kiro-agent junction --workspace default` | Full options |
| `junction agent update NAME --kiro-agent new-agent` | Update agent settings |
| `junction agent delete NAME` | Delete an agent |
| `junction workspace list` | List workspaces |
| `junction workspace create --name NAME --dir DIRNAME` | Create workspace (`--dir` is a **name under the data home**, not an absolute path) |
| `junction workspace create --name NAME --copy-from existing` | Copy from existing |
| `junction workspace update NAME --dir DIRNAME` | Update workspace dir (same containment rule) |
| `junction workspace delete NAME` | Delete workspace |

**On the CLI**, `--dir` must resolve to a **strict descendant** of
`$JUNCTION_HOME` (default `~/.kiro/crew`): anything landing outside — `/tmp/x`,
`../x`, `~/x` — is refused with a SEL `denied` audit event, and so is the data
home **root itself** (in any spelling: absolute, `~/.kiro/crew`, `.`, or empty),
since a workspace there would put agent-writable memory on top of `config.json`
and `.env`. The test is containment, not "is it absolute": an absolute path
landing *under* the home is accepted, since it resolves where the relative form
would. Pass `workspace-myproject`, not `/path/to/dir`.

Note the surface difference: the **dashboard** `POST /api/workspaces` DOES accept
an absolute `dir` (screened by `is_sensitive_path`, so `~/.ssh` / `~/.aws` /
keystone paths are still refused). The CLI is the stricter of the two.

## Apps

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `junction app list` | List installed apps |
| `junction app install /path/to/app-dir` | Install app from local directory (needs app.json) |
| `junction app enable NAME` | Enable an installed app |
| `junction app disable NAME` | Disable an installed app |
| `junction app uninstall NAME` | Uninstall an app and preserve its data directory |
| `junction app uninstall NAME --purge-data` | Uninstall and explicitly delete the app data directory |
| `junction app info NAME` | Show app details |
| `junction app init NAME` | Scaffold a new app (kebab-case name) |
| `junction app init NAME --backend --ui --cron` | Scaffold with backend, UI, and sample cron |
| `junction app dev NAME` | Toggle an app into dev mode (no-store UI serving + live reload on file change) |
| `junction app dev NAME --off` | Leave dev mode |

## Configuration

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `junction config get` | Show all config |
| `junction config get agent.provider` | Get specific value (dot-separated key) |
| `junction config set dashboard.url http://localhost:5476` | Set a config value (port is the JUNCTION_PORT env var, not a config key) |
| `junction config set --file config.json` | Load full config from JSON file |
| `junction config edit` | Open config in $EDITOR |

## Profiling (debug-only)

Off unless `JUNCTION_DEBUG=1` is set; the CLI is the only entry point. Emits folded
stacks (open in speedscope / flamegraph.pl). See `docs/architecture/design-notes/profiling.md`.

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `JUNCTION_DEBUG=1 junction perf sample --call mod:fn` | Profile that callable in-process (no extra dependency) |
| `JUNCTION_DEBUG=1 junction perf sample` | Attach to the running gateway (needs `pip install "junction[perf]"`) |
| `JUNCTION_DEBUG=1 junction perf sample --pid 1234 --seconds 30` | Attach to a specific PID for N seconds (1-300) |
| `... --interval 0.002` | Seconds between samples (0.001-1.0, default 0.005) |
| `... --output /tmp/p.folded` | Where to write the profile (default `./junction-profile.folded`) |
| `JUNCTION_DEBUG=1 junction desktop metrics` | Per-process CPU/memory of the **Electron** app (`--json`, `--top N`, `--path`) |

On macOS the attach path additionally needs elevated privileges (the OS denies
`task_for_pid`), so it may require sudo; `--call` needs neither py-spy nor sudo.

`desktop metrics` reads a recording rather than querying the app: `getAppMetrics()`
is Electron-main-only, so the app samples itself into an artifact when **started**
with `JUNCTION_DEBUG` set. Setting the variable only for the CLI does not make an
already-running app record -- restart it.

## Security & Eval

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `junction security audit` | Scan conversation history for suspicious tool usage |
| `junction security deny-list` | Show active deny patterns |
| `junction security events` | Show recent security event log entries (last 20) |
| `junction security events -n 50` | Show N entries |
| `junction security verify` | Verify security event log HMAC integrity |
| `junction eval` | Run smoke test evaluation (~30s) |
| `junction eval memory_recall_basic` | Run specific scenario by name |
| `junction eval --all` | Run all scenarios (slow) |
| `junction eval --judge` | Enable LLM judge scoring |

## Governance Policy (read-only)

Inspects the two-level security model (`effective = POLICY ∩ PROFILE`,
tightest-wins). All four verbs are read-only — the enterprise ceiling is never
edited through the CLI (its files are keystone-fenced so the agent cannot read or
write them).

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `junction policy show` | Show the effective enterprise security policy |
| `junction policy validate` | Load-check the policy + all profiles |
| `junction policy explain SCOPE ITEM` | Explain one tool/scope decision for a surface |
| `junction policy explain SCOPE ITEM --session-key K --agent A --app APP` | Scope the explanation to a surface |
| `junction policy profile NAME` | Show a profile by name |

## Cloud (Bring-Your-Own AWS)

Runs Junction on an EC2 instance in **your own** AWS account; credentials are
resolved by the `aws` CLI and never stored by Junction. All verbs accept
`--profile` / `--region`; the single-instance verbs also accept `--tag`
(defaults to the last launched instance).

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `junction cloud doctor` | Check cloud prerequisites + AWS reachability |
| `junction cloud launch` | Provision + configure an instance (interactive) |
| `junction cloud launch --size TIER -y` | Non-interactive launch at a size tier |
| `junction cloud launch --new` | Create a separate new instance instead of resuming the saved one |
| `junction cloud launch --keep-on-failure` | On bootstrap failure keep the instance for inspection |
| `junction cloud list` | List your Junction cloud instances |
| `junction cloud status` | Show one instance's state |
| `junction cloud connect` | Open the dashboard over an SSM tunnel |
| `junction cloud tunnel` | Open the dashboard SSM tunnel (standalone alias of connect) |
| `junction cloud connect --local-port N --no-browser` | Forward to a specific local port, no browser |
| `junction cloud login` | Sign kiro-cli in on the instance (fixes "not logged in" chat errors) |
| `junction cloud stop` | Stop the instance (pause billing) |
| `junction cloud start` | Start a stopped instance |
| `junction cloud destroy` | Remove the instance and ALL its AWS resources |
| `junction cloud destroy --dry-run` | Show the delete command without running it |
| `junction cloud iam-policy` | Print the least-privilege IAM policy to apply |
| `junction cloud iam-boundary` | Pre-create the immutable permissions boundary (admin, one-time) |

## Computer Use (Desktop Automation)

Default-OFF behind a keystone enable (`~/.kiro/crew/computer_use.json`, **not**
`config.json`). macOS only. These are human debug/diagnostic twins of the
`computer_*` MCP tools — the agent uses the MCP tools, not these.

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `junction computer doctor` | Report platform support, keystone enable state, and the advisory Accessibility / Screen Recording probe |
| `junction computer doctor --json` | Same as JSON |
| `junction computer apps` | List on-screen applications the accessibility layer can address |
| `junction computer call TOOL k=v …` | Run ONE computer-use tool through the same gated chokepoint the agent uses |
| `junction computer call --calls '[…]'` | Run a JSON array of calls in a SINGLE process, so `element_index` values stay resolvable |

## Snapshot & Restore

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `junction snapshot` | Create a portable backup of Junction state |
| `junction snapshot /path/to/dir` | Snapshot to specific output directory |
| `junction snapshot --keep 7` | Keep N most recent snapshots (default: 7) |
| `junction snapshot --list` | List existing snapshots |
| `junction restore` | Restore from most recent snapshot |
| `junction restore /path/to/snap.tar.gz` | Restore from specific snapshot |
| `junction restore --mode replace` | Replace mode (default) |
| `junction restore --mode merge` | Merge mode |
| `junction restore --dry-run` | Preview without applying |
| `junction restore --components memory,crons` | Restore specific components only |
| `junction restore --list-components` | List restorable components |
| `junction restore --force` | Restore even if gateway is running |
