"""Phase 3 — self-protection of the governance trust-root files (KEYSTONE).

Under "secure by default, not by mandate", the ONLY mechanism preventing a
prompt-injected agent from rewriting its own ceiling is that the policy/profile
files are on the sensitive-path floor (read + write blocked at every surface via
``is_sensitive_path``).  These tests pin that guarantee.
