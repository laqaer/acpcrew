"""Regression guard for issue #1050: module-scope ``junction.agent`` imports.

The four modules below historically used function-local
``from junction.agent import ...`` statements, several justified by
``# circular import`` comments that misstated the real import graph
(``junction.agent`` imports nothing from ``junction.dashboard.*`` or
``junction.session``).  The imports were hoisted to module scope; these
tests keep them there and prove no cycle exists in either load order.

Order-dependent cycles only surface in a fresh interpreter, not under a
bare import in an already-warm test process — hence the subprocess runs.
