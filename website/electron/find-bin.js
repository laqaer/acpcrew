 * Locate the junction backend binary by checking well-known paths in order.

 * without mocking globals.
 *
 * @param {typeof import("fs")} fs - Node fs module (needs `accessSync`, `constants.X_OK`)
 * @param {typeof import("os")} os - Node os module (needs `homedir()`)
 * @param {typeof import("path")} path - Node path module
 * @param {string|undefined} resourcesPath - `process.resourcesPath` (Electron only)
 * @param {string} dirname - `__dirname` of the calling module
 * @param {string} [arch] - CPU arch selecting the backend tree in universal
 *   bundles (defaults to `process.arch`)
 * @param {boolean} [isWindows] - whether the host is Windows (defaults to
 *   `process.platform === "win32"`). On Windows the backend ships as a real
 *   `junction.exe` console script under `Scripts\` (venv) — Node's `spawn()`
 *   does no PATHEXT resolution for a bare name, so an absolute `.exe` path is
 *   required.
 * @returns {string} Absolute path to the binary, or `"junction"` /
