"""Steward runtime — the session a steward lives in, the brief it carries, the nudge
that drives every turn, and the zero-LLM change detector that wakes it.

Four things live here and nothing else:

1. **Session launch/attach** (:func:`ensure_steward_session`, :func:`launch_steward`).
   A steward is an app-owned dashboard slot keyed ``steward-<id>`` (a steward an
   earlier build created keeps the key it was minted with; see
   ``steward_store.LEGACY_STEWARD_SLOT_PREFIXES``), which is the only worker shape
   without a wall-clock ceiling shorter than one issue's lifecycle.
   ``auto_research``'s campaign worker is the working precedent for the session
   shape, including the parts that look redundant: the explicit title with
   ``_titled = True`` (the loop's messages never trigger the auto-titler), and
   re-deriving the steward's auto-approve grant from the watchdog every cycle because
   the grant is in-memory only and a gateway restart drops it. The grant itself
   follows the TASK RUNNER instead: a scoped, expiring, SEL-audited
   ``SafetyOverride`` grant (:func:`autoapprove_scope`), never the unbounded
   ``slot._trust`` flag a human clicks.

2. **Brief injection by presence check** (:func:`brief_is_present`). Not a
   schedule, not a turn counter — one rule that covers session start,
   post-compaction, gateway restart and any truncation mechanism nobody has
   written yet.

3. **Nudge composition** (:func:`compose_nudge`). A volatile snapshot the steward
   must not guess at, plus the brief's ``Never`` list compressed to ~80 words.

4. **The sweep** (:func:`sweep_repo`), driven from ``watch.py``'s poll loop — the
   only always-on loop in this app. Zero LLM, zero credits: it compares the six
   unblock signals against a stored fingerprint and wakes the owning steward when one
   moves.

Nothing here writes to the forge, and nothing here writes a work item: a change
detector that touched ``last_progress_at`` would renew the very claim TTL the
protocol measures from it. Its own state lives in ``steward-signals.json``, beside
the stewards dir rather than inside it — ``steward_store.list_stewards`` globs
``*.json`` there, so a state file dropped in that directory would read back as a
phantom steward.

      on a watchdog that stopped — which is the point — and the next tool call parks

      scope key, so a steward whose slot the gateway no longer holds is rehydrated
      first — an armed loop fires against the slot key regardless, and it must land
      on a trusted session.
    * **The loop.** A steward whose autonudge loop is missing or deactivated has no
      clock at all; the sweep still wakes it on a signal, but it would never pick up
      new work again. Re-arming here makes "enabled" mean enabled.
    * **Revocation.** A steward that was disabled, retired or paused while its slot was
      resident keeps its trust until something takes it away. The BACKSTOP, not the
      first line: pause and retire revoke inline before they answer, and this cycle
      catches what they cannot — a record edited directly, and a restart that
      re-armed a loop for a steward that is no longer live.

      memory, so a restart empties them. Re-registering here is what keeps a ✕ and

    flag. Without this, a disabled Issue Radar keeps running unattended,
    auto-approved turns.

    TWO callers, and which is which matters:

    * :func:`on_app_disabled` — the FIRST LINE, awaited inside the disable request
      itself, so "stopped" is true by the time the operator's disable returns.
    * ``watch._poll_once``'s disabled branch — the BACKSTOP, for the disables this
      module can never be told about: ``junction app disable`` in another process,
      an ``installed.json`` edited on disk, and a gateway restart that re-armed
      loops for an app that is off. It runs on the poll interval by nature.

    GRANTS BEFORE LOOPS, and this order is load-bearing rather than tidy. The grant
    is the thing that lets a turn act unattended, and deactivating loops is the only
    step here that awaits — so doing loops first would hand the event loop back with
    the grants still live, and an armed timer that fired in that gap would get its
    auto-approved turn from the very call that was stopping it. Reversing these two
