# Hallucination filter — suppress Whisper-family transcription artefacts.
#
# Whisper models fed silence or low-energy audio produce two recognisable
# artefacts, and both are worse than an empty transcript in this app: the text
# goes to agents, so a hallucinated sign-off becomes a meeting note, and a phrase
# repeated forty times becomes forty note lines.
#
#  1. One phrase repeating ("Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. …")
#  2. Boilerplate unrelated to the audio — subtitle credits, sign-offs, stock
#     phrases memorised from the training set's video captions.
#
# Applied to every Whisper-family provider. The repetition collapse below is
# pure text logic and language-independent; the boilerplate list is English-only
# and matches nothing in a zh-CN or de-DE transcript, so a non-English recording
# gets the repetition half of this filter and none of the phrase half.
# AWS Transcribe uses a different decoder and does not produce these,
# so it is deliberately excluded rather than filtered "just in case" — running
# the filter there could only ever delete genuine speech.
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Boilerplate phrases Whisper hallucinates on silence. Compared case-insensitively.
# LIST DISCIPLINE: an entry must be a CAPTION ARTEFACT — text that exists because
# a transcript was produced, not because anyone spoke. "Implausible as dictated
# speech" was the earlier bar and it was not strict enough: it admitted sign-offs
# and subscribe CTAs ("thank you for watching", "don't forget to subscribe",
# "hit the bell", "see you in the next video"), which anyone recording a demo or
# dictating a video script says out loud. Because the match is whole-sentence and
# a transcript filtered down to nothing returns None, such an entry can delete the
# only sentence a recording had — the speaker's own words, unrecoverable. Those
# entries are gone, along with the ordinary-speech phrases dropped before them
# ("goodbye", "copyright", "thanks for listening", "thanks for joining", "see you
# next time", "all rights reserved").
#
# What remains is attribution text a caption track carries about itself. Nobody
# utters "Subtitles by the Amara.org community" into a voice memo, so no reading of
# these deletes speech.
#
# Residual, accepted deliberately: a single un-repeated hallucinated sign-off now
# survives into the transcript. That is the safe direction of the trade — one stray
# line a reader can see and ignore, versus silently destroying real speech — and the
# repetition collapse below still removes the far more common form of this artefact,
# where the model emits the same sign-off for the rest of the decode window.

# Boilerplate matches the WHOLE sentence only, never a substring and never a
