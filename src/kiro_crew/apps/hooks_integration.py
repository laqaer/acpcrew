"""Hooks Integration — wires the hooks system into the gateway lifecycle.

This module provides the glue functions that connect:
- RouteRegistry into the enable/disable flow
- LifecycleDispatcher into gateway startup/shutdown
- CronSDK cleanup into disable/uninstall

These functions are called from routes.py and server.py at the appropriate
lifecycle points. An app that declares no hooks is a no-op.
